### Hello 👋
## I'm just nobody who loves development and CyberSecurity

- 👓 The languages I know are: Python 3, PHP, Lua, JavaScript, C++ and Holy Rust (learning)
- 🎆 As far as CyberSecurity is concerned, I am starting in this wonderful field.
- 😴 I'm pretty lazy when it comes to putting my codes on GitHub so don't be surprised, same for the comments in my codes.
